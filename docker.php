                            Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. 
                        Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries 
                        and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, thanks to the container, the developer 
                        can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that 
                        machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.

                        In a way, Docker is a bit like a virtual machine. But unlike a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole 
                        virtual operating system, Docker allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as the system that they're 
                        running on and only requires applications be shipped with things not already running on the host computer. This 
                        gives a significant performance boost and reduces the size of the application.

                        And importantly, Docker is open source. This means that anyone can contribute to Docker and extend it to meet their 
                        own needs if they need additional features that aren't available out of the box.

                        Who is Docker for?
                        Docker is a tool that is designed to benefit both developers and system administrators, making it a part of many 
                        DevOps (developers + operations) toolchains. For developers, it means that they can focus on writing code without 
                        worrying about the system that it will ultimately be running on. It also allows them to get a head start by using one of 
                        thousands of programs already designed to run in a Docker container as a part of their application. For operations staff, 
                        Docker gives flexibility and potentially reduces the number of systems needed because of its small footprint and lower 
                        overhead.

                        Getting started
                        Here are some resources that will help you get started using Docker in your workflow. Docker provides a web-based 
                        tutorial with a command-line simulator that you can try out basic Docker commands with and begin to understand how 
                        it works. There is also a beginners guide to Docker that introduces you to some basic commands and container terminology
                        . Or watch the video below for a more in-depth look:
